Every endpoint has its own drawing routine, which contains an endpoint definition.\r\n *\r\n * The endpoint definitions must have the following properies:\r\n *\r\n * - (0,0) is the connection point to the node it attaches to\r\n * - The endpoints are orientated to the positive x-direction\r\n * - The length of the endpoint is at most 1\r\n *\r\n * As long as the endpoint classes remain simple and not too numerous, they will\r\n * be contained within this module.\r\n * All classes here except `EndPoints` should be considered as private to this module.\r\n *\r\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n * ### Further Actions\r\n *\r\n * After adding a new endpoint here, you also need to do the following things:\r\n *\r\n * - Add the new endpoint name to `network/options.js` in array `endPoints`.\r\n * - Add the new endpoint name to the documentation.\r\n *   Scan for 'arrows.to.type` and add it to the description.\r\n * - Add the endpoint to the examples. At the very least, add it to example\r\n *   `edgeStyles/arrowTypes`.\r\n * ============================================================================= */\n\n// NOTE: When a typedef is isolated in a separate comment block, an actual description is generated for it,\n//       using the rest of the commenting in the code block.

It is useful to have a model\r\navailable as to how it works. The following documents the relevant state items.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Network State\r\n\r\nThe following `network`-members are relevant to clustering:\r\n\r\n- `body.nodes`       - all nodes actively participating in the network\r\n- `body.edges`       - same for edges\r\n- `body.nodeIndices` - id's of nodes that are visible at a given moment\r\n- `body.edgeIndices` - same for edges\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n- helper nodes for dragging in `manipulation`\r\n- helper nodes for edge type `dynamic`\r\n- cluster nodes and edges\r\n- there may be more than this.\r\n\r\nA node/edge may be missing in the `Indices` member if:\r\n\r\n- it is a helper node\r\n- the node or edge state has option `hidden` set\r\n- It is not visible due to clustering\r\n\r\n\r\n## Clustering State\r\n\r\nFor the hashes, the id's of the nodes/edges are used as key.\r\n\r\nMember `network.clustering` contains the following items:\r\n\r\n- `clusteredNodes` - hash with values: { clusterId: <id of cluster>, node: <node instance>}\r\n- `clusteredEdges` - hash with values: restore information for given edge\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to nesting of clusters, these members can contain cluster nodes and edges as well.\r\n\r\nThe important thing to note here, is that the clustered nodes and edges also\r\nappear in the members of the cluster nodes. For data update, it is therefore \r\nimportant to scan these lists as well as the cluster nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cluster Node\r\n\r\nA cluster node has the following extra fields:\r\n\r\n- `isCluster : true` - indication that this is a cluster node\r\n- `containedNodes`   - hash of nodes contained in this cluster\r\n- `containedEdges`   - same for edges\r\n- `edges`            - array of cluster edges for this node \r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:**\r\n\r\n- `containedEdges` can also contain edges which are not clustered; e.g. an edge\r\n   connecting two nodes in the same cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cluster Edge\r\n\r\nThese are the items in the `edges` member of a clustered node. They have the\r\nfollowing relevant members:\r\n\r\n- 'clusteringEdgeReplacingIds` - array of id's of edges replaced by this edge\r\n\r\nNote that it's possible to nest clusters, so that `clusteringEdgeReplacingIds`\r\ncan contain edge id's of other clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Clustered Edge\r\n\r\nThis is any edge contained by a cluster edge. It gets the following additional\r\nmember:\r\n\r\n- `edgeReplacedById` - id of the cluster edge in which current edge is clustered\r\n\r\n\r\n   =========================================================================== */\nvar util = __webpack_require__(2);\nvar NetworkUtil = __webpack_require__(76)['default'];\nvar Cluster = __webpack_require__(228)['default'];\nvar Edge = __webpack_require__(74)['default']; // Only needed for check on type!\nvar Node = __webpack_require__(47)['default']; // Only needed for check on type!\n\n/**\r\n * The clustering engine\r\n */\n\nvar ClusterEngine = function () {\n  /**\r\n   * @param {Object} body\r\n   */\n  function ClusterEngine(body) {\n    var _this = this;\n\n    (0, _classCallCheck3['default'])(this, ClusterEngine);\n\n    this.body = body;\n    this.clusteredNodes = {}; // key: node id, value: { clusterId: <id of cluster>, node: <node instance>}\n    this.clusteredEdges = {}; // key: edge id, value: restore information for given edge\n\n    this.options = {};\n    this.defaultOptions = {};\n    util.extend(this.options, this.defaultOptions);\n\n    this.body.emitter.on('_resetData', function () {\n      _this.clusteredNodes = {};_this.clusteredEdges = {};\n    });\n  }\n\n  /**\r\n  *\r\n  * @param {number} hubsize\r\n  * @param {Object} options\r\n  */\n\n\n  (0, _createClass3['default'])(ClusterEngine, [{\n    key: 'clusterByHubsize',\n    value: function clusterByHubsize(hubsize, options) {\n      if (hubsize === undefined) {\n        hubsize = this._getHubSize();\n      } else if ((typeof hubsize === 'undefined' ?
